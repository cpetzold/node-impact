node-impact
===========

Initial Setup
-----------
1. Create the folder that you want impact to be installed into for your game
2. Move into that folder from the terminal
3. Issue the command: `npm install impact-fork`
4. Copy "tools", "media" and "lib" directories from impact.js into `node_modules/impact-fork/game/public` (get impact.js here: http://impactjs.com/)
5. Move into the `node_modules/impact-fork/` directory (this will be your home directory for your game from now on basically)
6. Run the command: `npm start` (you will see some output ending in "app listening on port 8080")
7. Open a web browser and browse to "http://localhost:8080/"
8. If you are starting with a fresh copy of impact, you will simply see a black square with the words "It Works!" inside


Update
----------
Periodically, you should check for updates to the library. To do this (and update), just issue the command:

`npm update impact-fork`
